## Body Proportions

### Head-to-Body Ratio

Juan uses **chibi proportions** at approximately **4 heads tall**:

```
┌──────────┐
│   HEAD   │  ← 25% of total height
├──────────┤
│  TORSO   │  ← 30% of total height
├──────────┤
│          │
│   LEGS   │  ← 45% of total height
│          │
└──────────┘
```

### Proportional Measurements (% of total height)

| Body Part                               | Measurement |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| **Total Height**                        | 100%        |
| **Head (cap to chin)**                  | 25%         |
| **Neck**                                | 3%          |
| **Torso (shoulders to waist)**          | 27%         |
| **Legs (waist to feet)**                | 45%         |
| **Arm Length (shoulder to fingertips)** | 38%         |
| **Shoulder Width**                      | 28%         |
| **Head Width**                          | 22%         |
| **Thigh Thickness**                     | 10%         |
| **Calf Thickness**                      | 7%          |
| **Upper Arm Thickness**                 | 7%          |
| **Forearm Thickness**                   | 5%          |
| **Hand Size**                           | 8%          |
| **Foot Length**                         | 12%         |

### Key Proportion Rules

1. **Head is large** — chibi-style, about 1/4 of total height
2. **Arms reach mid-thigh** when relaxed at sides
3. **Legs are longer than torso** (legs are about 1.7x torso length)
4. **Shoulders slightly wider than head**
5. **Hands are chunky** — simplified but expressive

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Wrong cap color**: Use dark charcoal `#3A3D3F`, NOT pure black
2. **Jacket closed**: Always show jacket OPEN with teal shirt visible
3. **Wrong proportions**: Head should be 25% of total height (chibi)
4. **Pure black outlines**: Use dark brown `#2E2218` for outlines
5. **Hard shadows**: Use soft cel-shading, not hard cutoff shadows
6. **Wrong facing direction**: Juan should face RIGHT in side view
7. **Missing cap logo**: Always include white geometric shield on cap
8. **Stiff hair**: Hair should be slightly messy, not helmet-like

---

## Workflow

1. **Identify the animation needed** (e.g., "dodge roll")
2. **Choose frame count** (use table above as guide)
3. **Copy base template** from Prompt Templates section
4. **Customize** the action description and sequence
5. **Add modifiers** for expression and action effects
6. **Generate image** with the reference images attached
7. **Verify consistency** with existing sprites
8. **Save to** `src/assets/juan/animations/`
